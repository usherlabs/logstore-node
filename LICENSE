These operating parameters are designed to protect the intellectual property
and collaborative effort invested in The Network. It aims to foster a healthy, interoperable ecosystem
supportive of The Network's goals and Usher Labs' interests.

   provided it adheres to the operating parameters defined herein, aimed at ensuring the Program's
   compatibility and interoperability within The Network ecosystem. These terms shall be in addition
   to and take precedence over the GNU Affero General Public License, Version 3, in the context of
   the software developed by Usher Labs Pty Ltd. The License Terms of the GNU Affero General Public
   License, Version 3, are incorporated herein by reference for the software developed under this license.

2. "The Network" refers to the Log Store Network or any future iterations or rebrandings of the
   network under the oversight of Usher Labs Pty Ltd. The terms of this license will continue
   to apply to The Network, irrespective of any changes to its name or branding, ensuring
   continuity and protection of Usher Labs' intellectual property and efforts.

3. Operating Parameters:

   a. **Interoperability**: The Program must maintain interoperability with The Network, supporting
   and enhancing its functionality, performance, and security standards.

   b. **Prohibition Against Independent Networks**: The Program, or any derivative works, shall not be
   used to create, facilitate, or operate an independent and non-interoperable decentralized network
   that is separate from or competitive with The Network, nor shall it be used in a manner that
   undermines the interests of Usher Labs Pty Ltd or The Network's ecosystem.

   c. **Contribution to The Network's Goals**: Modifications or enhancements to the Program should
   contribute positively to The Network's goals, including but not limited to scalability, security,
   and user adoption.

4. Commercial Licensing: Notwithstanding the above, entities interested in using the Program beyond
   the scope allowed under this license may contact Usher Labs Pty Ltd for a commercial licensing agreement
   at ryan@usher.so. This includes use cases that may require operating outside the defined operating
   parameters for specific commercial purposes.

5. Modifications to the Program for the purpose of development, testing, or prototyping are
   permitted, provided they do not breach the operating parameters or the intellectual property
   rights of Usher Labs Pty Ltd.

6. Violations of these terms regarding software developed and copyrighted by Usher Labs Pty Ltd
   are considered breaches of this license and may result in revocation of the rights granted herein.
